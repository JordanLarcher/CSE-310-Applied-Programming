# CSE-310-Applied-Programming

## Overview

As a software engineer, my goal is to enhance my programming skills. This project is a simple "Hello World" application in Scala, allowing me to get familiar with the language's syntax and development environment.

The software prints "Hello, World!" to the console, serving as an introductory exercise to build a solid foundation in Scala for future projects.

## Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:

- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, which provides excellent support for Scala development, including code completion and debugging features.
- **Build Tool**: SBT (Scala Build Tool) was used to manage project dependencies and build configurations efficiently.

The programming language I chose for this project is **Scala**. Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, allowing for concise and expressive code. Its interoperability with Java also enables the use of existing Java libraries, making it a versatile choice for software development.

## Useful Websites

Here are some websites that I found particularly helpful during this project:
